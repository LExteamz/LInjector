<h5 align="center">Yes, the name includes the word "Injector", it is not, LInjector is an executor and Lua<i>u</i> editor.</h3>


LInjector is an open-source interface for developers, designed to be minimal and easily customizable. <br>
[Learn more about Hyperion Byfron](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FRWTMnPZ-6fuyKjaT_YDU8tT1DrmLSw63YKtc2CfiMI/edit?usp=sharing).<br>
If you have a working Dynamic-Link Library (DLL), you can edit the source code of LInjector and make it work by yourself in any other way. <br>
LInjector uses the Monaco editor, the same one that powers Visual Studio Code, with syntax highlighting, developed by Krnl [and edited by Depso](https://github.com/depthso).

## About
LInjector is primarily developed by [Excel](https://github.com/ItzzExcel).\
It was created out of the necessity for a secure and open-source executor without the risks associated with popular ones.

## About the Structure of LInjector
A legitimate development tool.\
Designed using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) by [Excel](https://github.com/ItzzExcel).\
Written in C#, with .NET Framework 4.8, you can use any build architecture.

## How to Build?
To edit the Interface, first compile. For any reason, forms can't load if not compiled. If you opened the UI Editor before compiling, restart Visual Studio, and your problem should be fixed.
- Clone the repository :  `gh repo clone LExteamz/LInjector`
- Open LInjector.sln in Visual Studio 2022.
- Set Build Configuration to Release and your desired platform. (x64 or x86)
- Build the Solution, reload the Project and Build again.

## Why LInjector?
Well, here are some reasons:
- It's an open-source project, which ensures the program does not contain malware.
- Transparency about the state and code of LInjector. I can ensure you'll get a response about LInjector every time.
- The UI is beautiful and sigma (Actually, one of the best in the open-source market).
