<h3 align="center">LInjector | Open-source Lua Script Executor.</h3>

<hr/>

LInjector is an open-source interface for developers, designed to be minimal and easily customizable. <br>
We currently support The UWP Version. [Learn more about Hyperion Byfron](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FRWTMnPZ-6fuyKjaT_YDU8tT1DrmLSw63YKtc2CfiMI/edit?usp=sharing).<br>
If you have a working Dynamic-Link Library (DLL), you can edit the source code of LInjector. <br>
LInjector uses the Monaco editor, the same one that powers Visual Studio Code, with syntax highlighting, [developed by Krnl](https://krnl.place/) [and edited by Depso](https://github.com/depthso).

## About
LInjector is primarily developed by [Excel](https://github.com/NotExcelz) and [Depso](https://github.com/Depthso).\
It was created out of the necessity for a secure and open-source executor without the risks associated with popular ones.

## About the Structure of LInjector
A legitimate development tool.\
Windows Forms Application.\
Written in C#, with .NET Framework 4.8 | 32-Bit.\
I apologize for the uncommented code. If you have any questions, you can contact me via my Discord Server.

## How to Build?
To edit the Forms, first compile. For any reason, forms can't load if not compiled. If you opened the forms before compiling, restart Visual Studio, and your problem should be fixed.
- Clone the repository :  `gh repo clone NotExcelz/LInjector`
- Open LInjector.sln in Visual Studio 2022.
- Set Release x86
- Build Solution (CTRL + SHIFT + B)

## Why LInjector?
Well, here are some reasons:
- It's an open-source project, which ensures the program does not contain malware.
- Injection speed, the injection speed of LInjector has shown an advantage over other executors. Approaching about 0.3 seconds or 300 milliseconds.
- Optimized tab system. The tab system in LInjector is optimized to use no more than 1 Gigabyte of RAM, even with 40 tabs open.
- Transparency about the state and code of LInjector. I can ensure you'll get a response about LInjector every time.
